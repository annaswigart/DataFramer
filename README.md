## Overview

DataFramer is an interactive tool for examining single-dimensional overviews
of high-dimensional data sets and for planning out hypothesis to pursue during
the course of later exploratory analysis. 

Key features:
* Focuses users on examining the distribution of each of the variables in the
dataset in order to understand the fundamentals of the data set and catch
important basic errors.
* Encourages the planning of later phases of analysis and reduces flailing
by enabling the user to pose questions and identify which variables in the data
can be used to answer the question, or identify which questions cannot be 
answered with the given dataset.

## Usage
