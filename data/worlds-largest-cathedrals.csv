However it can only hold 18,000 persons at a time (compared with the 60,000 capacity of St Peter's Basilica in Rome &ndash; see below). It is also claimed to be the world's tallest domed church (although the dome is lower but the cross taller than that of St Peter's), the tallest Roman Catholic church in the world, and the tallest church in Africa. The claims made for its size appear to include the entire built structure, which includes a huge open forecourt imitating that at St Peter's. The measurements of area at St Peter's do not include its vast forecourt, or subsidiary buildings, only the actual church. This accounts for the great discrepancy in the number of people the two buildings will hold.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Our_Lady_of_Peace_of_Yamoussoukro
